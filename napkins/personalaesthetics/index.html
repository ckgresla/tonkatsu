<p>Trends or Fashions can be defined as waves of popularity wrt. clothing, thoughts and ways of living. At any given time the thing that is &ldquo;in&rdquo; is the thing that, let&rsquo;s say, the &ldquo;cool kids&rdquo; are doing &ndash; be it bell-bottom jeans, skinny jeans, eating the rich, etc. The changes in these Fashions reflect popular culture and the generally accepted principles for which people operate within &ndash; holes in shirts = drip, if you live in 2016. Now these might be worthwhile to pay attention to if a new and better solution is being provided to some problem, i.e. the Transformer architecture basically handles what a Recurrent Net does but with benefits like being non-sequential, pre-trainable and parallelizable. That being said, &ldquo;better&rdquo; is more often than not, not the metric for which people adopt new Fashions, what comes into and out of fashion seems to be somewhat arbitrary or at least things do not improve upon prior work.</p>
<p>So instead of following what the kNN voted Aesthetic is one might find it more fulfilling to think critically about the question of Fashion and Aesthetics and figure out for themself what they want to embody and how they want to live.</p>
<p>​</p>
<h2 id="why-have-a-usual-fit">Why have a Usual Fit?</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>It&rsquo;s Showtime: the show time effect is the effect experienced by those folks who get into costume to then go on stage. The ritual of donning your gear for a particular job; the NVGs for Special Forces, the Makeup for the Broadway Star or the Suit for the Executive. Simply the act of getting ready to do something helps you prepare for it and having your own Uniform builds that state of mind that you return to whenever you Don your gear. (I cannot find the link to the initial article but this point holds anecdotally)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Direction Looks Good: Being disheveled or not put together due to negligence does not feel good any more than it looks good, you should not aim to be photoshoot ready 24/7 but you should also not live life entirely hapazardly. Figuring out what works for you (a clean white t-shirt and jeans) and then sticking to it looks good &ndash; if you choose untidy then own it, but making that directed decision looks great.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Simplicity: Now you should think critically about how you want to live your life and with what gear, but you do not want to necessarily spend too much brain compute on figuring out how to get dressed. Having a usual fit simplifies that process and opens up RAM for solving AGI, determining how you will live your life in a manner that you will not regret and enjoying leaves when a breeze rustles them.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="what-then-is-real-fashion">What then is Real Fashion?</h2>
<p>If the widely accepted fashion, kNN voted via purchases of clothing or paying attention to ideas, is one that most people opt into without any thought of it &ndash; we may refer to this as an involuntary or unwitting fashion. Real Fashion might then be the thing which you choose to represent with your ideas and clothing after surveying what is available and then picking what fits you. This looks good because it is authentic and people deserve to live as their most authentic self.</p>
