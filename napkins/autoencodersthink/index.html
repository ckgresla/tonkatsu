<p>The Godfather of Artificial Intelligence, Geoffrey Hinton is infamous for his colorful intuitions that describe phenomena in ways that just freaking click. This has two effects, 1- makes learning fun (and therefore concepts get sticky) and 2- the understanding attained through rich intuitions leads to richer understandings. One brilliant example of this that is <strong>ridiculously awesome</strong> was presented in this lecture- <a href="https://youtu.be/zl99IZvW7rE">https://youtu.be/zl99IZvW7rE</a> with the particularly pertinent bit running from about 16:20 to 16:50.</p>
<p>​</p>
<p>The jist of the intuition:</p>
<ul>
<li>Encoders compress real world observations into a thought</li>
<li>Decoders expand thoughts into real world data (i.e. if you see cat in an image the decompression of the representation of cat could be writing the word “cat” or saying “that is a cat”)</li>
<li>Thoughts = Latent Representations</li>
<li>Autoencoders, whilst dealing with multi-modal datasets (e.g. captioning images) are effectively generating thoughts about what they see and translating that into a different real-world expression of the same concept (see <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ankushjain2001/aj2885_das968_Autoencoder_Image_Captioning/master/output/m_100eps_mse_adam_aug6739_32_16_16_5x5/000000024020_results.png">this image</a> from <a href="https://github.com/ankushjain2001/Image-Captioning-with-Autoencoders">this repo</a>)</li>
</ul>
<p>The romantic ponification, the “Latent Representation” that an Encoder creates works out to function similarly to the way we have thoughts — thoughts are not fully described if one tries to express their meaning in real-world data like speaking or writing. (i.e. thoughts are encapsulations of concepts at a lower level than real-world data like language or images which are much more rich, not as compressed) A romantic quote attributed to the Universe’s friend Albert Einstein goes something like “To sense that behind anything that can be experienced there is a something that our minds cannot grasp, whose beauty and sublimity reaches us only indirectly… This is Religiousness.” From this one might glean a take on what ideas are — the useful bits of the input data that our Brain recieves (famously the “thought handling” or conscious part of our Brain is only able to handle about 40-50 bits of information per second, a little bit smaller than the estimated 11 million bits the whole brain can handle per second). From this I come to think that Autoencoders, and by extension neural nets, are quite literally a simulation of Human thinking (as they were intended to be) and that to better understand the phenomena they pose we need to develop richer understandings of what is going on internally to us and the nets with more <strong>ridiculously awesome</strong> intuitions.</p>
