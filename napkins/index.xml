Businesses seem to cautiously separate their internal functions into 2 distinct categories. The first grouping contains things that will affect the bottom line in 5 minutes, 2 weeks, 3 months or up to 5 years, a more clearly defined temporal window then the timeframe our second group enjoys, this grouping focuses on moonshoty projects that may or may not change the entire trajectory of the Business and perhaps the world at large.</description>

Spoiler; the ridiculously good board is the HHKB2 Professional Hybrid or your pick of Happy Hacking Keyboard&amp;rsquo;s product line.
If specificity in specifications or a keyboard enthusiast-esque review is more your thing, this post from Material Journal is what pushed me over the edge to cough up the somewhat aggregious amount of cash that one of these boards will run you. Something around ~$240 USD as of August of 2022.</description>

Trends or Fashions can be defined as waves of popularity wrt. clothing, thoughts and ways of living. At any given time the thing that is &amp;ldquo;in&amp;rdquo; is the thing that, let&amp;rsquo;s say, the &amp;ldquo;cool kids&amp;rdquo; are doing &amp;ndash; be it bell-bottom jeans, skinny jeans, eating the rich, etc. The changes in these Fashions reflect popular culture and the generally accepted principles for which people operate within &amp;ndash; holes in shirts = drip, if you live in 2016.</description>

Learning is about running through data and developing a compressed representation of what you have seen in order to transform experience into knowledge that is useful in the future. If we attempt to learn things that are mundanely literal it kinda ends up being not fun — but having fun whilst learning might be the thing you exactly want to do. (see articles 1 &amp;amp; 2)

      <description>Akin to the &amp;ldquo;Ponderings&amp;rdquo; page, this collection of &amp;ldquo;Napkins&amp;rdquo; is a collection of ideas that I felt were better expressed in a series of paragraphs as opposed to a question.
Some of the world&amp;rsquo;s best ideas were incarnated on a napkin, these might be a few of mine.
​
The rest of this page will be a collection of examples for different features supported in the variant of markdown powering this website &amp;ndash; pretty stuff.</description>
