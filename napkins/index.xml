      <title>The Difference between ML and AI</title>

Throughout my travels in Cyberspace; journeying across countless github repos, enduring several senseless Zoom meetings, delving into the depths of many package docs and interacting with Technical &amp;amp; Non-Technical folk alike, I have always wondered where the generally acceptable line between Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) is to be drawn. It is a Friday Evening, I will be eating Ramen and will draw a somewhat arbitrary line in order to make what I believe is a meaningful (albeit nitpicky) distinction.</description>

Context I have spent the last few weeks immersing myself in the Policy Optimization Literature, within the larger field of Reinforcement Learning. This branch of Machine Learning has always been my &amp;ldquo;fancy&amp;rdquo;, of the main fields in ML, RL is the most &amp;ldquo;gangster&amp;rdquo;. This affinity for the field of figuring out how to create Agents that can learn things more closely to the way that humans learn is what has prompted me to wake up a little extra early each day; diving into papers and programming before the hitting the gym and before the main work day.</description>

      <title>Factor Analysis</title>

      <description>​
Simply Put Factor Analysis refers to statistical methods that reduce Variables in a Dataset to a smaller number of Factors, through Linear Combinations of Correlated Variables or with other dimensionality reduction techniques. It sees most of its use in traditional Statistics.
There are a few types of Factor Analysis methods:
Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA): make no a priori assumptions about what Variables will decompose into what factors (let the data tell you what combinations of Variables will make good Factors) reduce the number of input features Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA): looks to test a hypothesis on Actual Variables (assuming that some combination of Variables X &amp;amp; B decompose nicely into Factor x̄) Principal Factor Analysis (PFA): aims to get the lowest number of Factors that adequately (user needs to define what adequate is) describes the Variables, this is what most jump to (in ML) when thinking about FA at large.</description>

Canonically, Businesses seem to separate their internal functions product functions into 2 distinct categories. The first grouping contains things that will affect the bottom line in 5 minutes, 2 weeks, 3 months or up to 5 years, a clearly defined temporal window.The second group is one that focuses on moonshot-y projects that may or may not change the trajectory of the Business, their industry or perhaps the world at large.</description>

      <title>The Last Keyboard You Should Buy</title>

Spoiler; the ridiculously good board is the HHKB2 Professional Hybrid or your pick of Happy Hacking Keyboard&amp;rsquo;s product line.
If specificity in specifications or a keyboard enthusiast-esque review is more your thing, this post from Material Journal is what pushed me over the edge to cough up the somewhat aggregious amount of cash that one of these boards will run you. Something around ~$240 USD as of August of 2022.</description>

      <title>The Real High-Fashion</title>

      <description>​ Trends and Fashions are effectively tides of widespread popularity in the way we dress but also, perhaps more importantly, in the thoughts we express and hold. At any given time the thing that is &amp;ldquo;in&amp;rdquo; is the thing that, let&amp;rsquo;s say, the &amp;ldquo;cool kids&amp;rdquo; are doing &amp;ndash; be it bell-bottom jeans, skinny jeans, eating the rich, or what have you. The changes in these Fashion Trends reflect popular culture in that they are the generally accepted principles for which a majority of people operate within &amp;ndash; holes in shirts = drip (if you live in 2016).</description>

      <title>Autoencoders are Thought Machines</title>

Intelligence might be thought of as the ability to compress information. Learning then is being able to find useful compressions of larger concepts that can be queried or accessed in an efficent way. What learning about something feels like is a sort of grinding proccess of trying to find a representation of the concept that works for the way our Brain is wired and for the reason which we are attempting to understand this concept.</description>

      <description>Some of the world&amp;rsquo;s best ideas were incarnated on a napkin, here are a few digitized ones. This page is just a quick reference to see how what is supported in Hugo&amp;rsquo;s flavour of Markdown and the according syntax.
