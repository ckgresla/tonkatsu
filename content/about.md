## Raison d'être 
Life seems to be a sort of "pick your own adventure", meaning then is something we give ourselves. Here are a few items on my current [Raison d'être](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raison_d%27%C3%AAtre). 

- Learn about Intelligence by Building It
- Be Serious, without taking Myself too Seriously
- Expand the Perimeter of my Ignorance by increasing the Area of my Understanding
